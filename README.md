This is my vim configuration

I try my best to keep my configuration to work on Windows,Cygwin, OSX and Linux platform. Special notes for setting up the env will be here too. 

The core.autocrlf will make same env shared between windows and cygwin at one machine.  
git config --global core.autocrlf false
